# xRestaurant system

It’s a Django web application that represents multifunctional system designed for restaurants that save staff’s time, easier monitoring of the orders and what’s happening in the restaurant. 

## The system is divided into two main parts: 

- the first one is designed for the clients which makes payment orders easier - http://localhost:8000/
- the other part is for the waitresses who can supervise the orders, the free tables in the restaurant and other useful things - http://localhost:8000/get_orders/
